# selecting a word
- The computer will randomly select a word from the list of words and store it.
- dashes will be printed equivalent to the length of the word.

# guessing the word
- The player will have five attempts to guess the word correctly.
- The player will say a letter which he think is in the guess.
- if the guessed letter is correct, the computer will write the letter in it's position, and ommit the dash.
- if the letter is wrong, one attempt will be reduced and the letter guessed wrong should be printed.
- The logic should continue until the player either gets the word or exhaust his guesses
